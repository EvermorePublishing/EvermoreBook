# Evermore Book - University Libre
We asked Daniel Lyons from [LyonsType](https://lyonstype4.wixsite.com/homepage) to create a font that we can use on our publications, both PDF and on the web. We asked that the font be inspired by a font not commonly seen anymore, [University of California Old Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Old_Style).

This beautiful font has many OpenType features, including small capitals and discrestionary ligatures. It comes in four different styles: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic. It supports the standard Latin alphabet and has some other useful characters in "typesetting".

We new that what Daniel was going to create would be too good to keep for ourselves, which is why we asked that LyonsType licensed this font to us under the [OFL](https://www.openfontlicense.org) so anyone and everyone can use it for themselves.
